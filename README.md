# Saturn Travel Company

### Gonna make a game based off a website/project I designed in high school.

### Plan to make the website locally alongside other supplemental things (maybe like a brochure or something considering graphic design)
### Then try to make either a mobile app or a simple desktop application to fit my idea.

#### Maybe make it an idle game or an art-based things (supplimental 10 hour video placeholder thing but an app?).
