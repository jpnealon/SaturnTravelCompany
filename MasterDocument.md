This document is subject to change as I see fit and as the project progresses. See disclaimersa t the bottom of this document. 

### Overview

The initial plan for this project will be to focus on recreating my saturn travel company project that I made in high school for an astronomy assignment. 

### Website

In order to utilize my skills in html, css, php, and javascript, I plan to try and replicate a mock travel company website for the fictional "Saturn Traval Company" and will aim to be as detailed as I can towards my own representation of what realistic modern space travel company might be like.

### Brochure

At some point, I am going to try to find my high school journals to try and find my original designs but the original assignment was to design a "planet themed brochure" with the main intention to just be a fact sheet for an assigned planet, I just went above and beyond to create a fictional company and a general wix website (that I believe is now unrecoverable unfortunately).

### Game Development

- #### General Plans
    - A general spaceship landing game in mock block-world
    - Could eventually try to turn the spaceship into a designable thing like a build-your-own-block-ship-game

- #### Andriod
    - Primary Game Development
